This is my master's project.

ABSTRACT:
Machine Learning (ML) is essential for automating tasks, predicting outcomes, and aiding human
decision making, significantly enhancing human understanding. However, as ML evolves, ensuring
model reliability and transparency becomes increasingly critical. Users often rely on these models
without a clear method to verify their accuracy or uncover hidden biases. To address this challenge,
this project introduces an innovative solution by integrating blockchain technology with ML model
management. Unlike traditional methods that depend on centralized databases or third-party
validators, our approach uses the decentralized nature of blockchain to create a more trustworthy
and transparent system for managing ML models. Each model is recorded as a series of transactions
on the blockchain, preserving its history and integrity. This setup allows key components of ML
models, such as neural network weights and configuration details, to be stored securely.
Consequently, users across the network can independently access, review, and validate these
models, thereby increasing trust. The main benefit of using blockchain is that it promotes customer
trust through secure and transparent model management. The decentralized nature of blockchain
also ensures redundancy, where multiple copies of models are stored in different locations to
prevent data loss, thus allowing easy access to models with built-in redundancy. To demonstrate
the feasibility of this approach, we developed a prototype blockchain for storing neural network
predictive models. For efficiency, we further implemented a meta-block containing organized
model information, such as the indexing details of the classifiers and their review comments. We
validated this approach with a case study of storing real estate predictive models on blockchain,
demonstrating that this system successfully provides a secure, transparent, and immutable way to
manage ML models.
